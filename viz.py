X Trending: As Santa Clara County joins the rest of the Bay Area in beginning to reopen on Friday, face masks will become a bigger part of everyone\u2019s daily lives. But the county\u2019s largest city, San Jose, wants to go even further, requiring its residents to wear them most of the time they\u2019re out in public \u2014 never mind that police won\u2019t be looking to cite those who don\u2019t. Under the new county public health order, which takes effect Friday, residents must wear a face covering when at any business \u2014 even if it\u2019s outdoors \u2014 and on public transit. Businesses, for their part, will have to post signs reminding residents to wear a face covering. At all other times when residents are out in public, they are \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d to wear a face covering, the order states. The San Jose City Council has proposed an ordinance, which it likely will approve at its next meeting on June 2, that would go beyond the county order by requiring people to wear face coverings whenever they are in public places, including parks, or interacting with anyone outside their immediate household. \u201cIt is clearly the best practice throughout the world in dealing with this crisis,\u201d San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said about masks during a council meeting Tuesday night. \u201cAnd it\u2019s far less obtrusive than a lot of other things that we might have to do if we end up getting a second spike in cases.\u201d The face mask mandates from both the county and city come nearly a month after similar orders went into effect across the rest of the Bay Area counties \u2014 San Francisco, San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa and Marin. To spare police from having to enforce yet another law, Santa Clara County initially refrained from imposing an official order and instead issued a \u201cstrong recommendation\u201d for its 1.9 million residents to cover their faces when out in public. San Jose leaders followed suit until now because the county is in charge of developing public health guidelines. Police Chief Eddie Garcia has already indicated his officers will not be enforcing the city or the county order with a heavy hand because it would just serve as another example of agencies \u201cserving a public health issue as a public safety issue.\u201d \u201cI do fear that enforcement would impact our most vulnerable populations \u2014 the homeless, less affluent communities and others in which English is not their first language and they may not understand it,\u201d Garcia said. He urged the city against creating its own ordinance in addition to the county\u2019s, noting that \u201cwhen COVID-19 is gone, we\u2019re going to be left to deal with the credibility of this police department on how we enforce these laws and regulations.\u201d Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain in order to slow the spread of the coronavirus and to help stop people who don\u2019t know they have the virus from transmitting it to others. Starting Friday, here is where you are required to wear a face covering in Santa Clara County: Here are the exemptions: Here\u2019s when you can go mask-free: How San Jose would go further: San Jose\u2019s proposed ordinance would mandate that residents wear a face mask \u2014 or at least have them with them \u2014 in most instances when they leave the house. The proposal, submitted by vice mayor Chappies Jones and council member Sergio Jimenez, states that a face covering would be required when: Residents would not be required to wear a mask when exercising. But, if they were to walk in a park where dozens of residents are also enjoying the same space, they would be asked to put them on. The city would institute the same exemptions for children under the age of six, those unable to breathe while wearing a mask and those unable to put one on themselves. Some residents questioned why the city would move forward with an ordinance that they knew their police officers would not be enforcing. \u201cWhy are we creating a mandate that we don\u2019t expect a lot of people to follow?\u201d resident Brandon Alvarado asked the council during Tuesday night\u2019s meeting. \u201cEven the chief of police isn\u2019t interested in the enforcement of this.\u201d But Liccardo compared the new regulation to the city\u2019s fireworks ban, saying they both serve the purpose of encouraging \u201csocial enforcement.\u201d \u201cThe reason we\u2019d have something like this knowing that we\u2019re not going to be out there arresting people or issuing fines at every violation is that it is important to establish norms of behavior and laws do serve that purpose,\u201d he said.'
