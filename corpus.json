X Trending: As Santa Clara County joins the rest of the Bay Area in beginning to reopen on Friday, face masks will become a bigger part of everyone\u2019s daily lives. But the county\u2019s largest city, San Jose, wants to go even further, requiring its residents to wear them most of the time they\u2019re out in public \u2014 never mind that police won\u2019t be looking to cite those who don\u2019t. Under the new county public health order, which takes effect Friday, residents must wear a face covering when at any business \u2014 even if it\u2019s outdoors \u2014 and on public transit. Businesses, for their part, will have to post signs reminding residents to wear a face covering. At all other times when residents are out in public, they are \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d to wear a face covering, the order states. The San Jose City Council has proposed an ordinance, which it likely will approve at its next meeting on June 2, that would go beyond the county order by requiring people to wear face coverings whenever they are in public places, including parks, or interacting with anyone outside their immediate household. \u201cIt is clearly the best practice throughout the world in dealing with this crisis,\u201d San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said about masks during a council meeting Tuesday night. \u201cAnd it\u2019s far less obtrusive than a lot of other things that we might have to do if we end up getting a second spike in cases.\u201d The face mask mandates from both the county and city come nearly a month after similar orders went into effect across the rest of the Bay Area counties \u2014 San Francisco, San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa and Marin. To spare police from having to enforce yet another law, Santa Clara County initially refrained from imposing an official order and instead issued a \u201cstrong recommendation\u201d for its 1.9 million residents to cover their faces when out in public. San Jose leaders followed suit until now because the county is in charge of developing public health guidelines. Police Chief Eddie Garcia has already indicated his officers will not be enforcing the city or the county order with a heavy hand because it would just serve as another example of agencies \u201cserving a public health issue as a public safety issue.\u201d \u201cI do fear that enforcement would impact our most vulnerable populations \u2014 the homeless, less affluent communities and others in which English is not their first language and they may not understand it,\u201d Garcia said. He urged the city against creating its own ordinance in addition to the county\u2019s, noting that \u201cwhen COVID-19 is gone, we\u2019re going to be left to deal with the credibility of this police department on how we enforce these laws and regulations.\u201d Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain in order to slow the spread of the coronavirus and to help stop people who don\u2019t know they have the virus from transmitting it to others. Starting Friday, here is where you are required to wear a face covering in Santa Clara County: Here are the exemptions: Here\u2019s when you can go mask-free: How San Jose would go further: San Jose\u2019s proposed ordinance would mandate that residents wear a face mask \u2014 or at least have them with them \u2014 in most instances when they leave the house. The proposal, submitted by vice mayor Chappies Jones and council member Sergio Jimenez, states that a face covering would be required when: Residents would not be required to wear a mask when exercising. But, if they were to walk in a park where dozens of residents are also enjoying the same space, they would be asked to put them on. The city would institute the same exemptions for children under the age of six, those unable to breathe while wearing a mask and those unable to put one on themselves. Some residents questioned why the city would move forward with an ordinance that they knew their police officers would not be enforcing. \u201cWhy are we creating a mandate that we don\u2019t expect a lot of people to follow?\u201d resident Brandon Alvarado asked the council during Tuesday night\u2019s meeting. \u201cEven the chief of police isn\u2019t interested in the enforcement of this.\u201d But Liccardo compared the new regulation to the city\u2019s fireworks ban, saying they both serve the purpose of encouraging \u201csocial enforcement.\u201d \u201cThe reason we\u2019d have something like this knowing that we\u2019re not going to be out there arresting people or issuing fines at every violation is that it is important to establish norms of behavior and laws do serve that purpose,\u201d he said."

X Trending: SAN FRANCISCO \u2014\u00a0 In a conversation with Bay Area school leaders, the state\u2019s top educator said Thursday that plans are underway to extend school districts\u2019 current flexibility to stop taking attendance or to drop standardized tests during the coronavirus pandemic. California Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said two proposals are making their way through the Legislature \u201cin the coming days and weeks\u201d to \u201cgive districts the flexibility they need but also give them stable funding they need to carry out\u201d a modified form of school that students will face in the coming year. \u201cThe Legislature has to vote on this, and we expect to have the answers in the days and weeks to come,\u201d Thurmond said. \u201cBut as all of our superintendents have said, right now the main focus has to be the safety and well-being of our students and how we support our staff.\u201d His comments come a day after Thurmond released state guidance calling on districts to prepare for the likely scenario of continued distance learning, face coverings in schools, smaller class sizes and the logistically difficult work of separating lunch schedules, keeping school buses socially distant and spreading students out while on campus. The state superintendent made the comments during a televised special conversation on ABC7\u00a0 with San Francisco Unified School District Superintendent Vincent Matthews, Oakland Unified School District Superintendent Kyla Johnson-Trammel and San Jose Unified School District Superintendent Nancy Albarran. Facing a June 30 expiration date for guidelines set in place by Gov. Gavin Newsom in March that stipulate school districts will be fully funded despite not taking attendance, school districts across the state are eagerly awaiting a decision from state officials on a possible extension or a new funding model. \u201cWe\u2019re wrestling with what is education going to look like in the fall,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cWe are going to need flexibility to plan adequately. What we don\u2019t want to do is put a plan in place and find out we have regulations saying we can\u2019t. Our hope is that the flexibility we have around daily attendance and number of days required to be open will continue so we can plan without hitting a brick wall.\u201d It\u2019s clear that districts will have to shell out big bucks to make the sweeping changes to in-person education that Thurmond announced on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned from the experience of (the 1918 flu) pandemic,\u201d Thurmond said Wednesday. \u201cWe know that we can flatten the curve by doing a few simple things,\u201d like social distancing, hand washing and using face coverings. Thurmond said his department has created a task force to draft guidelines for the state\u2019s 1,037 public school districts to reopen for the new school year. Behind the scenes, state officials like Thurmond are lobbying the federal government for financial support to help pay for the millions of dollars that will need to be pumped into California schools for them to be able to adhere to social distancing requirements and the continued delivery of distance learning programs. Based on what superintendents across the Bay Area have said in the past two months, the health and safety guidelines that districts will be compelled to adhere to require more, not less, funding from the state. The cost to administer standardized tests alone is a staggering figure the largest districts in the area would rather not deal with.

To put them in that situation I think is a disservice to them. Getting a bad result may just contribute to the anxiety they feel.\u201d"

Vaccines typically require years of research and testing before reaching the clinic, but scientists are racing to produce a safe and effective vaccine by next year. Antibody produced in response to a vaccine SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus Antibody produced in response to a vaccine SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus Antibody produced in response to a vaccine SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus Work began in January with the deciphering of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The first vaccine safety trials in humans started in March, but the road ahead remains uncertain. Some trials will fail, and others may end without a clear result. But a few may succeed in stimulating the immune system to produce effective antibodies against the virus. Here is the status of all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans, along with a selection of promising vaccines still being tested in cells or animals. New additions and recent updates: \u2022\u00a0 The Chinese company Anhui Zhifei Longcom began Phase II trials. \u2022\u00a0 Maryland-based Novavax announced U.S. government funding. \u2022\u00a0 Canada-based Medicago announced a Phase I trial. \u2022\u00a0 A vaccine by CanSino Biologics was approved for military use. The development cycle of a vaccine, from lab to clinic. PRECLINICAL TESTING: Scientists give the vaccine to animals such as mice or monkeys to see if it produces an immune response. PHASE I SAFETY TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to a small number of people to test safety and dosage as well as to confirm that it stimulates the immune system. PHASE II EXPANDED TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to hundreds of people split into groups, such as children and the elderly, to see if the vaccine acts differently in them. These trials further test the vaccine\u2019s safety and ability to stimulate the immune system. PHASE III EFFICACY TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to thousands of people and wait to see how many become infected, compared with volunteers who received a placebo. These trials can determine if the vaccine protects against the coronavirus. APPROVAL: Regulators in each country review the trial results and decide whether to approve the vaccine or not. During a pandemic, a vaccine may receive emergency use authorization before getting formal approval.  WARP SPEED: The U.S. government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program is expected to name five or more vaccine projects to receive billions of dollars in federal funding before there\u2019s proof that the vaccines work. We will update the tracker and label the Warp Speed projects when there is an official announcement. COMBINED PHASES: Another way to accelerate vaccine development is to combine phases. Some coronavirus vaccines are now in Phase I/II trials, for example, in which they are tested for the first time on hundreds of people. (Note that our tracker would count a combined Phase I/II trial as both Phase I and Phase II.) Vaccines that use one or more of the coronavirus\u2019s own genes to provoke an immune response. DNA RNA DNA RNA DNA RNA PHASE IIModerna\u2019s vaccine dazzled the stock market in May with Phase I data on just eight people, only to see its stock price drop when experts had a lukewarm reaction to the results. The vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA for short) to produce viral proteins. The American company is eyeing Phase III trials in July and hopes to have vaccine doses ready by early 2021. PHASE I PHASE IIThe German company BioNTech has entered into collaborations with Pfizer, based in New York, and the Chinese drug maker Fosun Pharma to develop their mRNA vaccine. On July 1, they announced that all the volunteers for their Phase I/II trial produced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, while some experienced moderate side effects such as sleep disturbances and sore arms. In an interview, Pfizer\u2019s CEO said that he hoped his company could begin delivering vaccines in October, providing hundreds of millions of doses by the end of 2020, and then up to a billion by the end of 2021. PHASE I PHASE IIImperial College London researchers have developed a \u201cself-amplifying\u201d RNA vaccine, which boosts production of a viral protein to stimulate the immune system. They began Phase I/II trials on June 15 and have partnered with Morningside Ventures to manufacture and distribute the vaccine through a new company called VacEquity Global Health. The researchers expect to know if the vaccine is effective by the end of the year. PHASE I PHASE IIIndian vaccine-maker Zydus Cadila has created a DNA-based vaccine. On July 3 they announced approval to start human trials, becoming the second company in India to enter the Covid-19 vaccine race after Bharat Biotech. PHASE I PHASE IIOn June 30, the Japanese biotechnology company AnGes announced they had started safety trials on a DNA-based vaccine, developed in partnership with Osaka University and "

Lee, Sarah Mervosh, Yuriria Avila, Barbara Harvey and Alex Leeds MatthewsUpdated July 10, 2020 All 50 states had begun to reopen in some way after the coronavirus thrust the country into lockdown starting in March. Now, a growing number of states are pausing plans to reopen, amid rising case counts. Several are reimposing restrictions they had lifted earlier \u2014 for example, Texas, which closed bars after a spike in cases. There were already substantial variations in how states were deciding to open up, with some forging far ahead of others. These maps show where several major sectors have reopened. The changes \u2014 and backtracking \u2014 reflect the immense pressure on the nation\u2019s governors to respond to a crippled economy and an anxious public, even as epidemiologists warn of a second wave of cases. The New York Times is tracking when broad reopenings are allowed, as well as when reopening plans are paused or reversed. States may shift categories as conditions change, or to account for changes in the national landscape. Even as governors lift orders and allow reopenings, stricter local orders may remain in place. This page will be updated regularly. Some states have reopened every major sector, though businesses are almost universally under restrictions, such as allowing fewer customers, requiring workers and customers to wear masks, and enforcing social distancing. Many states are reopening in stages, allowing some sectors to open ahead of others. Several states have reopened some sectors, but paused or delayed plans to reopen further after seeing a rise in coronavirus cases. Some states have moved to close certain sectors statewide or in certain counties after seeing a surge in cases.

The 14-day trend was upward in both cities. As of June 26, the part of Atlanta within Fulton County had 2,885 COVID-19 diagnoses, up from 2,738 on June 24. Sandy Springs had 622 diagnoses, up from 589. Atlanta remains the number one city in the county for COVID-19 diagnoses at 45.9% of the total, and Sandy Springs remains in third place with 9.9% of the total. The 14-day trend in new COVID-19 in each city is charted in the report, calculated by comparing the 14 days preceding the previous seven days with the 14-day period before that. In Atlanta, the 14-day trend rose by 56.7% and in Sandy Springs the 14-day trend was up by 54.9%. A chart of COVID-19 diagnoses by city in Fulton County as shown in a June 26 Board of Health report. To view the full reports, see the county website here. It is unclear whether the numbers reflect the coronavirus\u2019s spread, the state of testing, or both. The statistics, which are based on patients\u2019 home addresses, are not completely accurate due to such factors as a large number of patients whose cities or ZIP codes are unknown. Of those diagnosed, their ZIP code was unknown in 957 cases and their home city was unknown in 610 cases. All numbers are preliminary and may be adjusted later, including through \u201cdata cleaning\u201d \u2014 the reassignment of some cases to a different ZIP code or city after further analysis. The statistics for local ZIP codes in the June 26 report had unexplained discrepancies, with all but one showing a decrease in the number of cases, but also a percentage increase in cases, and no note that there had been \u201cdata cleaning\u201d or other corrections. The report also showed a spike in the number of cases with unknown ZIP codes, which went from 300 in the June 24 report to 957 in the current report. The total number of confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses in the county as of June 26 was 6,285, up from 5,959 on June 24. Of those, 311 are reported as having died.

Meanwhile, officials are urging residents to be safe, wear a mask, and continue to practice social distancing. ATLANTA - Georgia is experiencing a spike in COVID-19 cases and doctors say it isn't just because more people are getting tested. Gwinnett County now has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the state with 6,043 confirmed cases. Rounding out the top three are Fulton County, with 5,444 confirmed cases as of Wednesday and DeKalb County, which has 4,666 cases.\u00a0 Fulton County has the highest coronavirus deaths. Yes, testing has increased, but that doesn\u2019t explain the increased numbers, doctors say. \"It\u2019s not only volume of testing contributing to our numbers,\" Dr. Danny Branstetter, a medical director of infection prevention with Wellstar said. Advertisement \"The percent positive is also increasing, leading to evidence that we are experiencing the increased ongoing spread of this virus in our community,\" he said. Brent Jones made a Kroger run for milk and yogurt without his mask. He says normally has one, but thinks he\u2019ll be alright from the quick in-and-out trip. Dr. Brandstetter says something covering your face is better than nothing. \"If it\u2019s contained within that paper mask, it\u2019s not [as likely to] impact others,\" He also says rural communities should keep their guard up, especially now. \"Our rural communities are having that much higher rates than our cities.

Right now, there are 1,124 people currently at the hospital for COVID-19.\u00a0 The graph below shows total hospital numbers, which includes the confirmed COVID-19 cases that were hospitalized at the time the case was reported to DPH or when the case was interviewed. \u00a0On Wednesday, DPH said there had been 10,313 hospitalizations. The state reports each day how many people are on ventilators \u2013 which has dropped after peaking over 900 on Tuesday. It's a gauge on the severity of the illness, be we want to point out, this number reflects the total number of patients on ventilators for any reason - not just COVID-19. Because we know about a third of patients historically have needed this kind of support \u2013 it makes sense that this number will follow the rise and fall in cases.
